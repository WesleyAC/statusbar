# statusbar

This is a simple script to output a [i3bar-compatible](https://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html) statusbar, written in pure Rust. It shows the current time in Taipei, San Francisco, and New York, the currently connected wifi SSID (fetched via netlink/nl80211), and the remaining battery to the nearest tenth of a percent.
